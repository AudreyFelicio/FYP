# Audrey Felicio Anwar - CP4101 BComp Dissertation Final Year Project

This repository contains algorithm implementations for solving the `Ulam Median` problem. For details on what algorithms are implemented, please refer to Chapter 6 in the `reports/report.pdf`. The following two papers are used for reference:

- [Approximating the Median under the Ulam Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00868)
- [Clustering Permutations: New Techniques with Streaming Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01821)

## Building The Project
You can compile all the algorithms by doing the following:
```sh
# Make sure your current working directory is the root of this repository
mkdir build
make
```

`make` will compile all the algorithms in one go and the resulting executables will be available inside `build` folder.

## Dataset Generators
The generator implementation is available in `generator.cpp`. It takes in 2 integers `n, m` from standard input. the first integer `n` denotes the length of the permutation and `m` denotes how many permutations to generate.

To build the generator separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make generator
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/generator > sample.txt
10 10
```
Will generate the dataset containing 10 permutations inside `sample.txt`.

## Algorithms

All the algorithms below takes in the dataset generated by `generator.cpp` as input.

### `bruteforce.cpp`

Results in the executable `build/bruteforce`. For details on what this algorithm does, refer to Section 6.1.1 in `reports/report.pdf`. To build it separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make bruteforce
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/bruteforce < datas/3_6.txt
```

### `best_from_input.cpp`

Results in the executable `build/best_input`. For details on what this algorithm does, refer to Section 6.1.2 in `reports/report.pdf`. To build it separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make best_input
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/best_input < datas/3_6.txt
```

### `relative_order.cpp`

Results in the executable `build/relative`. For details on what this algorithm does, refer to Section 6.1.3 in `reports/report.pdf`. To build it separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make relative_order
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/relative < datas/3_6.txt
```

### `approx_median.cpp`

Results in the executable `build/approx`. For details on what this algorithm does, refer to Section 6.1.4 in `reports/report.pdf`. To build it separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make approx_median
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/approx < datas/3_6.txt
```

### `naive_local_search.cpp`

```sh
make tabu_search
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/tabu_search < datas/3_6.txt
```

### `iterated_local_search.cpp`

Results in the executable `build/iterated_local`. For details on what this algorithm does, refer to Section 6.2.3 in `reports/report.pdf`. To build it separately, you can use the following command:
```sh
make iterated_local_search
```

An example run:
```sh
./build/iterated_local_search < datas/3_6.txt
```
