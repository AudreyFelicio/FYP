\chapter*{Abstract}
Finding a representative of a huge set of data has been a fundamental problem in big data analysis. As an example, one may be interested in finding the median of a certain dataset as a representative of the whole data. This problem finds numerous applications in fields such as computational biology, DNA storage system, and speech recognition.

In this thesis, we will explore various works that have pushed the boundaries of this research interest. Specifically, we will be looking at a special problem of finding the median string under the Ulam metric, where all the data are permutations and the distance between two data is defined as the minimum number of symbol moving (deletion and then insertion) needed to transform one into the other.

We shall delve into attempts made to improve the state-of-the-art polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem. In addition to it, some attempts on proving the hardness of the problem by means of finding a chain of reduction from NP-Hard problems are also shown. Lastly, some implementation of the state-of-the-art approximation algorithms and heuristical algorithms such as stochastic local search are provided to help bridge the gap between theory and practice by verifying the theorems empirically.
