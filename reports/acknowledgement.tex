\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I am immensely grateful to my supervisor Assistant Professor Diptarka Chakraborty for his unwavering support, valuable guidance, and constructive feedback throughout the entire research process. Without his expertise, encouragement, and many times valuable insights, this thesis would not have been possible. It has truly been an honor to have him as my supervisor for this research.

I would also like to thank my family, friends, and colleagues for their constant encouragement, motivational words, and unwavering belief in me. Their continuous emotional and moral support has kept me motivated and strong throughout the most difficult times of this thesis. This thesis could not have been completed without the support of all of you.

Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to National University of Singapore for their support on my journey into this research and for providing me with the required resources, which have been essential to the completion of this thesis.
